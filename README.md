# Team Project - Part 1

Parts of a team project to create a computer simulator. Contains only the parts I've written (specifically for part 1 of the project - later on these parts were re-written more efficiently by a group member. thank you group member).
In my defense, it was my first time using Java and didn't know of all the capabilities (still don't but I'm learning).
